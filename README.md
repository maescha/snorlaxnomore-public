- 🎥 **Curated Workout Playlist Management**: Access a library of random workout videos stored in an .csv file created by **you** that you can also add to. Snorlax will return a random video on command, offering new routines and inspiration
  > - `!add` to add videos
  > - `!play` to return random video

- 🗓️ **Randomized Workout Routines**: Get a custom workout routine generated on the fly based on a specific equipment type (`!eq [equipment name]`) or muscle group (`!musc [muscle name]`)
- 🚀 **Motivation & Discipline Hacks**: Struggling with procrastination or low motivation? Snorlax utilizes Gemini to offer quick, actionable tips and tricks to help you build discipline and stay on track
- 👋 **Friendly Greetings**: Snorlax is polite! He'll greet you back, ready to start your fitness journey together. Wake him up by calling `!hello`
